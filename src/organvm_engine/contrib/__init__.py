"""Contribution engine — outbound contribution tracking and backflow routing.

Discovers contrib repos (seed.yaml tier:contrib), checks upstream PR status,
classifies knowledge types, and routes backflow signals to appropriate organs.

Thesis: one contribution, seven returns. Each outbound PR generates typed
knowledge that flows back into the system through organ-specific channels.
See essay-8 (The Recursive Proof) for the theoretical foundation.
