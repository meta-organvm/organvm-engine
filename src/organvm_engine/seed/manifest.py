"""Workspace manifest — declares which organs are present in a partial checkout.

A workspace-manifest.yaml at the workspace root enables organ-scoped
workspaces for collaborators who only need a subset of the full system.

When present, discover_seeds() limits scanning to declared organs.
When absent, all organs are scanned (full-workspace behavior).

Manifest uses CLI short keys for organs (I, II, META, etc.) — the same
keys used by the `organvm` CLI and `organ_config.organ_dir_map()`.
