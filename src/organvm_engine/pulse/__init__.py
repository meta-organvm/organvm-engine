"""Pulse module — the system's nervous system and self-awareness layer.

Fifteen sub-layers:
    events      File-based event bus (append-only JSONL)
    types       Engine-specific event type constants
    emitter     Unified bridge to ontologia's event bus
    heartbeat   Organism diffing (what changed between snapshots)
    temporal    Time awareness (velocity, acceleration, trend detection)
    affective   System mood (qualitative health summary)
    density     Interconnectedness measurement (edge saturation, coverage)
    ammoi       Adaptive Macro-Micro Ontological Index (multi-scale density)
    rhythm      Pulse cycle orchestration (scan → compute → store → emit)
    nerve       Subscription wiring (seed-declared event subscriptions)
    continuity  Session briefing (what happened recently)
    shared_memory  Cross-agent knowledge store
    flow        Dependency flow visualization (active/warm/dormant edges)
    inference_bridge  Bridge to ontologia inference (tensions, clusters)
    advisories  Governance advisory system (policy evaluation → recommendations)
    default_policies  Built-in governance policies
